- Model building: Given data predict the  likelihood of **Preeclampsia** (a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys)

$$Y = f(X)$$


- Incorporate this into the device to generate an alert when the likelihood of having  Preeclampsia is high.
