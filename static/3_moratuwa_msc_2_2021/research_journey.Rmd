## General Objectives

- To identify epidemiological outbreak pattern of DF/ DHF in each district of Sri Lanka.

- To identify and quantify the nonlinear, 
    nonstationary association between climatic factors and dengue counts.
    

    
## Specific objectives

- To identify periodic pattern in dengue counts and how it progress through time.

- To identify districts with similar dengue dynamic pattern.


- To identify nonstationary association between dengue counts and climate variables.

- To identify the delayed effect of climate variables on dengue incidence.


- To identify the nonlinear association between climate variables and dengue incidence.

- To determine whether there are change-points, where dynamics shifted transmission pattern in dengue and climate variables.


---

## Significance of the study

- Time for the allocation of resources

- Lagged observed climate variables could provide lead for forecasting disease epidemics

- Benefit for optimizing current dengue surveillance and control programmes

- Budget planning

## Wavelet Analysis

- Wavelet transform: decompose a time series into a time dependent sum of frequency components.

- To identify seasonal oscillations with time-varying intensity and frequency.


---

## Wavelet Transform

- Shift a wavelet to the right until you have covered the whole signal.

- Scale (stretch) the wavelet and repeat

## Conclusions

- Two peaks of the disease occur at annual and semi annual scale.

- Two clusters based on dengue dynamic pattern were identified.

- Except Kalutara and Trincomalee districts distribution of other districts among clusters may have influenced from monsoon winds.

- Dengue incidence showed significant coherence with all climatic factors but with different periodicities and phase relationships.

- Wavelet phase analysis revealed a lag difference between climate variables and dengue incidence.

- 22 change points were detected in the variation of dengue cases based on CPA.

- CPA revealed changes in the variation of dengue incidence was very much similar to the changes in precipitation, humidity and maximum temperature.

## Conclusions (cont.)

- DLNM revealed,

    - Mean Temperature 250C – 270C at lag 1 – 8 weeks
    - Precipitation > 70mm at lag 1- 5 weeks and 20- 50mm at  lag 10 – 20 weeks
    - Humidity 65% - 80% at lag 10 – 18 weeks
    - Visibility > 14 km
    
    have a **positive impact** on the occurrence of dengue incidence.
    
- DLNM revealed,

    - Mean Temperature > 280C at lag 6 – 25 weeks
    - Maximum Temperature lag 4 – 6 weeks
    - Precipitation > 65mm at lag 15 – 20 weeks
    - Humidity < 70% at lag 4 – 9 weeks
    - Visibility < 14km
