"The VIX index represents the market’s estimate of the future volatility of the S&P 500 over the next thirty
days. It provide a benchmark of the short-term expected volatility, as futures and options contracts can be
inscribed on (see Whaley, 2008). In fact, implied volatility reflects the market makers’ point of view about the
expected volatility of the futures’ underlying assets. Therefore, since market makers are often among the most
informed agents, implied volatility should outperform the historical one in forecasting the realized volatility
of the futures’ underlying asset (Shu and Zhang, 2012)."

.tiny["Despite the importance and the common use of VIX as a volatility measure, only little attention has been paid
to the problem of forecasting it. In particular, the few works on the subject show that the VIX is to some extent
predictable. This finding, albeit theoretically interesting, is not necessarily helpful for traders, because VIX is
tradable only as derivative contracts, whose dynamics does not always follow that of the VIX index. For
example, Asensio (2013), Degiannakis (2008), Kostantinidi et al. (2008), Konstantinidi and Skiadopoulos
(2011), who are among the few authors focusing on VIX futures (henceforth referred to as VXFs), highlight
only a weak evidence of statistical predictability and experience a low level of profitability when implementing
trading strategies based on VIX forecasts. The overall picture is not encouraging for investors: on the one hand,
there is evidence that VIX is predictable; on the other, it seems very hard to trade VXFs by learning from the
(predicted) VIX dynamics. "]
